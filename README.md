A memory card game matching German articles with their cases and genders.

You can currently choose between definite and indefinite articles, as well as the number of cards you'd like to match.

Inspired by my Udacity Memory Game project and a morning in my German class where I was supposed to know the answer to 'Plural Genetiv' within mere seconds. I didn't. But I do now.
